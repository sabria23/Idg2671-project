Props You Would Pass to Each Component
Each component would receive specific props:

What Are Props?
Props (short for "properties") are a fundamental concept in React that allow components to communicate with each other. They are the primary mechanism for passing data from a parent component to a child component.
Think of props like arguments you pass to a function. When you create a component in React, you can give it certain properties (props) that it can use to render properly.

## PublishToggle:
study: The study object with title, published status, etc.
onToggle: Function to handle publishing/unpublishing


## ShareableLink:
studyId: The ID of the study
studyUrl: (optional) The full URL to display, or calculate it inside


## EmailInvitation:
studyId: The ID of the study
onSendInvitations: Callback for when invitations are sent


## DemographicsSettings:
studyId: The ID of the study
isPublished: Whether the study is published (for disabling the save button)
onSave: Callback for when settings are 

How to Pass Props
1. Passing Props from Parent to Child
In the parent component, you pass props to a child component like HTML attributes:
jsx// ParentComponent.jsx
import ChildComponent from './ChildComponent';

function ParentComponent() {
  const studyTitle = "Cognitive Study";
  const isPublished = true;
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildComponent 
        title={studyTitle} 
        published={isPublished} 
        onSave={() => console.log("Saved!")} 
      />
    </div>
  );
}

In this example, we're passing three props to ChildComponent:

title: A string value
published: A boolean value
onSave: A function

2. Receiving and Using Props in the Child Component
The child component receives these props as a parameter in the component function:
jsx// ChildComponent.jsx
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>Status: {props.published ? 'Published' : 'Draft'}</p>
      <button onClick={props.onSave}>Save</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;

In this example, we're passing three props to ChildComponent:

title: A string value
published: A boolean value
onSave: A function

2. Receiving and Using Props in the Child Component
The child component receives these props as a parameter in the component function:
jsx// ChildComponent.jsx
function ChildComponent(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{props.title}</h1>
      <p>Status: {props.published ? 'Published' : 'Draft'}</p>
      <button onClick={props.onSave}>Save</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ChildComponent;

### to implement where a study link becomens inaccessible to pariticipants when a reseacher unpiblishes it:

in backend i need to add this line: 
// ðŸ‘‡ This is the key check that prevents access to unpublished studies
    if (!study.published) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        success: false, 
        message: "This study is currently unavailable" 
      });
    }
 and also make the route public 

 and in frontend i iwll need to create a public study access compoent that navigates either to marius page if it is publish or to anot found page it is not accessible.

 3. Testing the Implementation
To ensure this feature works properly, you should test these scenarios:

Access a published study link â†’ Should show the study
Unpublish the study â†’ The link should become inaccessible
Publish the study again â†’ The link should become accessible again
Access a non-existent study â†’ Should show a "not found" error
Access a study with a malformed ID â†’ Should handle the error gracefully

### implementing sharebale link generation for studies after it has been published
Overview of the Implementation
The shareable link feature consists of three main parts:

1. Backend API to generate (and optionally track) study links
2. rontend component to display and copy the link
3. Access control logic to ensure only published studies are accessible

current implementaiton: 
Current Implementation:

Frontend Component (ShareableLink.jsx):

Renders a UI for displaying a shareable link
On mount (or when published changes), it attempts to fetch a shareable link from the backend via fetchShareableLink()
Makes a GET request to http://localhost:8000/api/studies/${studyId}/link
Displays the URL received from the backend, with a visible error if the request fails


Backend Controller (generateLink function):

Receives a request for a specific study ID
Checks authorization (verifies the user has permission to access the study)
Verifies the study exists and is published
Constructs a URL by concatenating a base URL with the study ID: ${baseUrl}/public/study/${studyId}
Returns this URL in the response


Authentication Middleware:

Protects the API endpoint to ensure only authenticated users can generate links
Extracts and verifies the JWT token from the request headers
Attaches user information to the request object

It's more of a "here's the URL format for accessing a published study" rather than "here's a special link that gives access to this specific study."
