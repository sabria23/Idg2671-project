Email System Architecture with SendGrid
The email invitation system you're building will rely on a client-server architecture with SendGrid as the delivery provider:

Your Application: The interface researchers use to compose emails and manage invitations
Backend API: Processes requests, manages queues, and interacts with SendGrid
SendGrid API: Handles the actual email delivery, tracking, and reporting
Recipient Mailboxes: Where your emails ultimately need to arrive (and not in spam)

This architecture separates concerns:

Your app focuses on the user experience
SendGrid handles the complex delivery infrastructure
