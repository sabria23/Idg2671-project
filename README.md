to run the server: make sure you are in the root direcotry and not inside backend nor frontend, in the terminal type: npm run server
- P.S. if that does not work it could be that you need to go to your Backend folder and then try running npm run server
- we are using the ES6, so express is using in the package.json "type": "module"
- if you make any changes in the .env, save the file and restart the server
- Please use POSTMAN/thunder or whatever other api client checker before moving any further after creating routes ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹

instalations: we have:
## for front-end:
"react": "^19.0.0",
"react-dom": "^19.0.0",

## for the backend:
  "dependencies": {
    "bcryptjs": "^3.0.2",
    "colors": "^1.4.0",
    "dotenv": "^16.4.7",

    "express": "^4.21.2",
    "jsonwebtoken": "^9.0.2",
    "mongoose": "^8.12.1"
