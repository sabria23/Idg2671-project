to run the server: make sure you are in the root direcotry and not inside backend nor frontend, in the terminal type: npm run server
- P.S. if that does not work it could be that you need to go to your Backend folder and then try running npm run server
- we are using the ES6, so express is using in the package.json "type": "module"
- if you make any changes in the .env, save the file and restart the server
- Please use POSTMAN/thunder or whatever other api client checker before moving any further after creating routes ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹
